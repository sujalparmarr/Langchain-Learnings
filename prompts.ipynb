      "PE ratio stands for price-to-earnings ratio. It’s a quick way to gauge how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar a company earns.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How it’s calculated:\n",
      "  - Trailing PE = stock price / earnings per share (EPS) over the last 12 months.\n",
      "  - Forward (or estimated) PE = stock price / expected EPS for the next year (based on analyst estimates).\n",
      "\n",
      "- What it means (in simple terms):\n",
      "  - If a stock is $100 and its trailing EPS is $5, the trailing PE is 20. Investors are paying $20 for each $1 of the company’s recent yearly earnings.\n",
      "  - A higher PE can mean the stock is expected to grow a lot or is just expensive. A lower PE can mean it’s cheaper or maybe there are problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Quick example:\n",
      "  - Price = $100, trailing EPS = $5 → trailing PE = 100 / 5 = 20.\n",
      "  - If next year’s expected EPS = $6 → forward PE = 100 / 6 ≈ 16.7.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Important cautions:\n",
      "  - PE isn’t a guarantee of future performance. A high or low number can be due to growth expectations, risk, or even accounting quirks.\n",
      "  - It doesn’t account for debt, cash flow, or how fast a company is growing.\n",
      "  - Companies with no earnings or big one-time charges can have misleading or meaningless PE.\n",
      "\n",
      "- How to use it well:\n",
      "  - Compare a company’s PE to its industry peers and to the overall market.\n",
      "  - Look at the trend over time (rising or falling PE) and consider forward estimates.\n",
      "  - Use it with other metrics (like growth rate, PEG ratio, debt, cash flow) for a fuller picture.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want, I can calculate the PE for a specific stock and explain what it suggests.\n"
